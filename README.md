# Virtual Salon

We proposed an economic, suitable, and visualized hairstyle design system, namely Virtual Salon, to help people see their ideal hairstyle in advance. The Virtual Salon can recommend ideal hairstyles for users through our Hairstyle Recommendation Module. A synthesis image of the users with their ideal hairstyle can be generated by our Synthesis Module. Users can even further adjust details of the hairstyle likes making bangs longer, which is supported by our Hairstyle Detail Adjust Module. The whole visualized process can give the users an intuitive impression on how they will look like with certain hairstyles and colors, narrowing the communication cost between barbers and customers and contributing to a better service.Technically, in Virtual Salon, a similarity-based recommendation system is deployed in Hairstyle Recommendation Module to produce candidate reference images, helping users to find their favorite hairstyles and hair colors. We also utilize GAN model in Synthesis Module and Hairstyle Detail Adjust Module, to transfer various styles to userâ€™s face, generate multiple renderings, and enable users to adjust details of the hairstyle.
