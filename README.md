# Virtual Salon

We proposed an economic, suitable, and visualized hairstyle design intelligent system
Virtual Salon to help users get the image of the users with their ideal hairstyle. Virtual
Salon would recommend ideal hairstyle for users through our Hairstyle Recommendation
Module. The synthesis image of the users with their ideal hairstyle would be generated by
our Synthesis Module. Users could even further adjust details of the hairstyle likes making bangs longer, which is supported by our Hairstyle Detail Adjust Module. The whole
visualized process can give the users an intuitive impression on how they will look like
with certain hairstyles and colors, narrowing the communication cost between barbers
and customers and contributing to a better service.In Virtual Salon, a similarity-based
recommendation system is deployed in Hairstyle Recommendation Module to produce
candidate reference images, helping users to find their favorite hairstyles and hair colors.
We also utilize GAN model in Synthesis Module and Hairstyle Detail Adjust Module,
to transfer various styles to userâ€™s face, generate multiple renderings, and enable users
to adjust details of the hairstyle.
